<p>The main purpose of this module consists in providing other modules
with the information they need. In order to fulfill this task, the module
basically packs the values of several related parameters in the form of
DO_Text objects, sometimes furnished with apposite attributes, which are
interpreted by other modules.

<p>The main purpose of this module consists in showing an area of the metal
tool used in the embossing procedure as large as a paper sheet.
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><a href="../online/modules/Customer/Embossing/Embossing.html">Embossing</a></font>
<p>Embossing uses the bump geometries saved in the bump database in order
to generate a mesh for a whole paper sheet or a paper roll. In the latter
case a flat, but longer geometry is generated; other modules are required
in order to produce a roll. Embossing basically runs an ANSYS script in
order to produce a mesh for a basic cell. This mesh is saved in an ANSYS
db file, zugmesh.db, which is in its turn read in by the script started
by the Traction module, when a traction simulation is later eventually
requested.
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><a href="../online/modules/Customer/EmbossingSimulation/EmbossingSimulation.html">EmbossingSimulation</a></font>
<p>EmbossingSimulation&nbsp; takes care that the Embossing module may always
find the data it needs. The purpose of this module is the visualisation
of a roll or sheet of paper. This visualisation requires a geometric description
of paper bumps, which in turn is the output of an LS-DYNA simulation. This
computation is in general time-consuming, and that is why the output of
these simulations should be stored in a database. EmbossingSImulation checks
whether the results for the bump at issue are already available in the
database. If they are not an LS-DYNA simulation is started and its output
is saved in the database. The preprocessing for the LS-Dyna is done with
ANSYS.
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><a href="../online/modules/Customer/KnobShape/KnobShape.html">KnobShape</a></font>
<p>KnobShape produces a simplified but quite realistic representation of
the geometry of a knob.
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><a href="../online/modules/Customer/MergeAndNormals/MergeAndNormals.html">MergeAndNormals</a></font>
<p>MergeAndNormals corrects a field of normal vectors calculated by GenNormals.
GenNormals does not correctly work out the normals if the connectivity
of the polygon object is not seamless. This is unfortunately the case at
issue. Here the seams appear between neighbouring basic cells. FixUsg might
correct this problem, but this solution would not be acceptable because
the computation of FixUsg is very time-consuming. MergeAndNormals may be
much faster than FixUsg because it directly looks for the places where
seams are present, and instead of eliminating them the <i>wrong</i> normal
values are corrected.
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><a href="../online/modules/Customer/Traction/Traction.html">Traction</a></font>
<p>Traction starts an ANSYS traction simulation. The ANSYS script file
name is zug_driver.log. This script applies on a basic cell a force directed
along the X axis. The applied force is such that the force per unit length
has the value 1 in the system of units employed. The value itself is not
very relevant, because we are looking for the traction resistance loss.
This number appears in percent in the info message window.
