<P>
This document is a short introduction to working with COVISE. It is primarily a 
tutorial for COVISE novices. It doesn't cover advanced topics such as the 
development of new application modules or the installation and configuration 
process. We assume that you have a running COVISE on your machine. For installation 
guide read the files <I>README</I> and <I>INSTALL.TXT</I> which come with your 
COVISE distribution. For developing new application modules read the 
<I>COVISE Programming Guide</I>.

<P>
COVISE is a Collaborative Visualization and Simulation Environment developed 
at the Computing Center of the University of Stuttgart. It is an
extendable distributed software environment to integrate supercomputer based 
simulations, postprocessing, and visualization functionality with
cooperative working in a seamless manner.

<P>
The tutorial contains the following section:

<P>
Program names and COVISE module names are printed <B>bold</B>, for example the 
command to start COVISE: <B>covise</B>, or the name of the module that
computes a cutting plane: <B>CuttingSurface</B>. 

<P>
Output to the console window which COVISE produces is printed in fixed space font like
