With Speaker/Home you select which video you will see (if available).
 
To speak and transmit your video image during meetings, first make sure you have permission to
speak. If you do not have permission to speak, ask the moderator to grant you permission.

%Note: If you have an audio/video problem, you might need to change your audio/video preferences by
%clicking the preferences button beside the audio controls and the video window.

\vspace{0.5cm}
{\bf Testing your Audio and Video}
\vspace{0.5cm}

Ensure that your microphone, speakers, and video camera work properly by testing your equipment
before attending your first meeting. 

%You can test your audio and video equipment by choosing option
%"Test my Audio Video" in the Connect window or by clicking "Test Audio/Video" in the Meeting Center.

The Moderator determines who can speak and transmit video during the meeting. The Moderator also
determines which of the two types, or modes, of audio is available during meetings:
\begin{itemize}
\item Automatic Microphone mode
\item Request Microphone Mode
\end{itemize}
  
\vspace{0.5cm}
{\bf Speaking in Automatic Microphone Mode}
\vspace{0.5cm}

All meetings begin in Automatic Microphone mode. If you have permission to speak, you can speak into
your microphone at any time and all tne meeting participants hear you. If you have a video camera
attaced to your computer, your image is transmitted to the other participants while you are speaking.
Only two participants can speak at once.

\vspace{0.5cm}
{\bf Speaking in Request Microphone Mode}
\vspace{0.5cm}

If the moderator switches to Request Microphone Mode, you must request the microphone before you can
speak. If you do not have permission to speak, you must ask the moderator for permission before you
can request the microphone.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Click Request Microphone. (If there is no Request Microphone button, the meeting is in
Automatic Microphone mode.)
\item A "waiting to talk" icon appears next to your name in the Participant List details.
When the current speaker releases the microphone, the next person who requested the microphone
can speak.
\item After you receive the microphone a "currently talking" icon appears next to your name in the
Participant List.
\item Speak into your microphone. Everyone in the meeting hears you. If you have a video camera
attached to your computer, everyone sees your video image when you speak.
\item When you finish speaking, click Release Microphone to aöllow the next person to speak.
\end{enumerate}
