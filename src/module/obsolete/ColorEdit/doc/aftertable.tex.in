The example network above shows a cuttingplane on which colors are mapped. 
To map the scalar data of the CuttingPlane its dataOut port is connected to the 
dataIn port of the ColorEdit module which maps the scalar values according to 
its colormap to color data. Afterwards the meshOut data of the CuttingPlane module 
and the color data is combined by the collect module.  

After starting the ColorEdit module an Editor pops up. In the ColorEdit window the 
colormap can be edited or loaded from file and send to the module by clicking the 
apply button in the Editor (Please make sure to apply a colormap that gives a visible
picture in the Renderer - check by clicking in the colormaps list in the information
area).  

The next image is a snapshot of the results in the Inventor Renderer.

The colormap editor is a tool to create colormaps in a fast and comfortable way. 
This editor is available as an input parameter e.g. through the ColorEdit module.  

A colormap is a function that assigns colors to scalar values. Colormaps can be 
saved to and read from files. The user can choose between two different interpolations - 
the linear and the spline one. The interval between the control points is filled by 
linear or cubic interpolation in RGB space.  

To send the colormap parameter to the module and execute the module the "execute button" on the bottom of 
the window has to be pushed.  

\begin{covimg}{}
		{b1}{The ColorMapEditor Panel}{0.7}\end{covimg}

With the colorbrowser you can specify colors by dragging the RGB or HSV sliders. 
The current color is displayed in a small window. The minimum and maximum values for 
each component is 0 and 1. The maximum of the hue value is 360.

\begin{covimg}{}
		{b2}{Color Browser}{0.7}\end{covimg}
		
Opacity can be changed with an other slider. It is displayed in an extra window as 
the current color with the current opacity and a pattern as background shining through 
more or less. Alpha = 0 means totally opaque, alpha = 1 totally transparent.  

\begin{covimg}{}
		{b3}{Transparency Slider}{0.7}\end{covimg}

The palette window shows the current spectrum of colors. It can show the three 
color components or optional the color components plus the opacity. 
This window is a truecolor window that shows the colors in 16.7 million colors 
which gives a very good impression of the colormap and the opacity but will only 
work on work stations with such a visual.  
		
\begin{covimg}{}
		{b4}{Palette Window}{0.7}\end{covimg}

The function display shows the curves of the four components in a frame. 
The three color component curves of the RGB-model have the corresponding color 
and the opacity is a black curve. In this window the curves are only displayed 
and cannot be manipulated directly.  

\begin{covimg}{}
		{b5}{Function Display}{0.7}\end{covimg}

\begin{covimg}{}
		{b6}{Control Point Slider}{0.7}\end{covimg}
		
With the control point slider the positions of the different control points 
can be edited. By dragging the mouse with the left mouse button pressed you can move 
single points. Dragging with the right button squeezes the colormap; this means 
dragging the mouse to the right stretches the colormap left of the point and 
compresses it on the right side. Clicking on a slider with the middle button 
destroys it and clicking in an empty region of the slider creates one with 
exactly that color of the colormap. There is always one slider selected. 
You can recognize it by the black line on it. Sliders can be selected 
by clicking on them with the left or right mouse button. 
If a new slider is created it will be selected automatically. 
The color of the selected point is shown in the colorbrowser and can be edited there.

\begin{covimg}{}
                {b9}{ColorEditor Menu Bar}{0.7}\end{covimg}
		
The leftmost entry in the menu bar contains all the operations to load and save a colormap.  
		
\begin{covimg}{}
                {b18}{"File" Pulldown Menu}{0.7}\end{covimg}

"new" deletes the old colormap and creates a new default one shown in the following picture. 
The interpolation mode is set to linear. The borders are 0 and 1.
		
\begin{covimg}{}
                {b21}{The Editor after the "New" Operation}{0.7}\end{covimg}

Selecting "open" pops up a file selector as shown in the figure.  
				

\begin{covimg}{}
                {b22}{Open File Dialog}{0.7}\end{covimg}
		
After the colormap file on the right has been selected push the O.K. button to load it. 
The old colormap will be lost.  

"save" pops up a dialog box to write the name of the current colormap for saving it.  

		
\begin{covimg}{}
                {b23}{Save a ColorMap}{0.7}\end{covimg}

"quit" exits the programm  

						
\begin{covimg}{}
                {b20}{"Arrows" Pulldown Menu}{0.7}\end{covimg}

If the arrows are sensitive the colorbrowser and the current control point are unlinked. 
So if the user wants to copy the color of the colorbrowser to the current controlpoint 
the down arrow must be pushed and visa versa. The sensitivity of the arrows can be 
changed in the arrows menu of the menubar. If the arrows are set unsensitive the 
current control point is shown in the colorbrowser and will be updated automatically 
when changing the colorbrowsers color.

%
%If the display performance is too low either due to the network or the machine, 
%so that changing the colormap by dragging is to slow, you can change the drag 
%mode to "button-up apply" mode. This means the new colormap will be calculated 
%and shown if you release the mouse button after dragging the sliders.  
		
\begin{covimg}{}
                {b16}{"display mode" Toggle Button"}{0.7}\end{covimg}

Here the user can switch the display mode of the palette window between 
the opaque and transparency mode. This does not change the colormap itself. 
In the opaque mode you only see the three color components. 
The transparency mode shows the background pattern shining through the 
colormap less or more. This display mode is slower.  

		
\begin{covimg}{}
                {b10}{Opaque display of palette}{0.7}\end{covimg}

\begin{covimg}{}
		{b17}{"Interpolation Mode" Toggle Buttons}{0.7}\end{covimg}
								
As shown in the figures the toggle changes the kind of interpolation used 
between the control points. 
Changing this mode is completely reversible.

		{b14}{Linear Interpolation}{0.7}\end{covimg}

\begin{covimg}{}
		{b12}{Spline Interpolation}{0.7}\end{covimg}
		
\begin{covimg}{}
		{b15}{Borders dialog fields}{0.7}\end{covimg}								

Obsolete:
In the two entry fields the borders of the colormap can be adjusted. 
After typing a new border press return to confirm it. The left value must be less the right one. 

%Note: {\bf Please do not use Min and Max in the ColorEditor Panel - 
%     - obsolete, no function!!! Use parameters in CtrlPanel instead!!!}
