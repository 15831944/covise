In 3DTexVR.net the module ReadStar\_1 modules again read in the dataset.
At the first output port the computational grid is available and at
the second output port the turbulent energy (TE).
The module Colors\_3 maps the TE data to colors.

DomainSurface\_1 computes the edges lines of the computational grid.

CuttingSurface\_1 computes an cutting plane and the module Colors\_1 maps
the data on the plane to colors. It takes the colormap from the module
Colors\_3.

Sample\_1 transforms the unstructured grid and data on it to a uniform grid
with data. Colors\_2 maps the data on the uniform grid to colors.
It takes the colormap from the module
Colors\_3. 

The module ShowGrid\_1 computes a wireframe representation of three outer surfaces
of the uniform grid.

CuttingSurface3DTex\_1 combines the unstructured grid and colors and the
structured grid an colors into a set.

When COVER\_1 gets this object it loads a plugin (CuttingSUrface3DTexPlugin)
which creates a 3D texture from the uniform grid and provides the
preview mode for cuttingsurface interaction.
