% short description what the module does
%
CuttingSurface3DTex combines a cuttingsurface and colors on a cuttingsurface with
an uniform grid and color on a uniform grid into a set of two geometry
objects. The uniform grid and the colors on the uniform grid 
represents the voxels of a 3D texture. 

\begin{covimg2}	{} {CuttingSurface3DTexModule} {0.7}\end{covimg2}

The purpose is to get a very fast preview mode for the cutting surfaces 
in the Virtual Reality Renderer COVER. As the computation of a cuttingsurface
on a unstructured grid needs some time, interactive setting of cutting surfaces
in impossible in COVER. Therefore the standard cuttingsurface interaction
in COVER is to position an icon as replacemnet for the real cuttingsurface 
(called interactor). When the user has finished the interaction he presses a 
button which then starts the cuttingsurface module with the position an
orientation of the current cuttingsurface.

3D textures (which are supported in hardware by SGI Onyx Systems), allow to
move a polygon through the 3D texture and map the colors of the 3D texture on 
the polygon interactively.

By sampling the unstructured grid and the data on it to a uniform grid
and interpreting this as a 3D texture, the 3D texture feature of the
Onyx can be used as a preview mode for cutting surface interaction.

Instead of an interactor icon the user moves a polygon through the dataset,
on which the colors of the 3D textured are mapped at runtime.
When he found an interesting cuttingsurface, he presses the button which start the
CuttingSurface module of COVISE. After a few seconds the cuttingsurface 
on the unstructured grid is visible.

CuttingSurface3DTex is available for all COVISE versions on all platforms.
It doesn't support sets at the moment.
