In tutorial\_grid\_1.net (first map) the module RWCovise reads in the 
computational grid of a channel with two inlets.
DomainSurface computes the outer surface of the channel. At the first output 
port the surface polygons are available. When connected to the Renderer module, 
the surface appears in the renderer window.

\begin{covimg}{}%
		{DomainSurfaceMap2}{covise/net/tutorial/tutorial\_grid\_2.net}{0.6}\end{covimg}

 
In tutorial\_grid\_2.net (second map) the third port is connected to the renderer.
As a result you see only the outer edges in the renderer window.

\begin{covimg}{}
		{DomainSurfaceMap3}{covise/net/examples/DomainSurface.net}{0.6}\end{covimg}

If you want to show data on the outer surface you have to connect the data output port of a modul which
reads/creates the data to the second (optional) input port (third map). The data on the surface/lines are available at the
second/fourth ouput port. To map them as colors on the surface/lines use a module from the category colors and
combine the colors with the polygons/lines to a geometry object with the module Collect. In the map
covise/doc/examples/DomainSurface.net the second RWCovise module reads in the pressure distribution in the
 unstructured grid. DomainSurface computes the outer surface and the data on the outer surface.
