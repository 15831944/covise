% short description what the module does
%
The module SimplifySurface reduces the number of triangles in a surface.

% input of a module icon for example
% #1	path for eps
% #2  picture name
% #3  scale factor
\begin{covimg2}{}{SimplifySurface}{0.7}\end{covimg2}

If no data values are attached to the surface, a geometric reduction algorithm is invoked. 
Otherwise the reduction will be done with respect both to the
data values and to geometric properties of the surface. 
The module generates normals for the simplified surface.

% short information about versions 
%
% This covlink is obsolete
%In versions 4.4 and 4.5 the module \covlink{SurfaceReduce}{SurfaceReduce}{../../Filter/SurfaceReduce/SurfaceReduce.html} is available. It covers a subset of the functionality of the module
%SimplifySurface and is recommended to be replaced in versions higher than 4.5 by the latter.
