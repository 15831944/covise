        no\_startp & Slider & The starting points of the stream lines are defined by 
                              equidistantly deviding the line segment reaching from 
                              \textit{startpoint1} to \textit{startpoint2} by 
                              \textit{no\_startp} points.\\
\hline
        startpoint1 & Vector & Starting point of the line segment yielding the stream lines.  \\
\hline
        startpoint2 & Vector & End point of the line segment yielding the stream lines.  \\
\hline
        direction & Choice &  Selects if the stream lines are calculated up-stream (selection: \textbf{forward}) 
                              down-stream (selection: \textbf{backward}) or in both directions (selection: \textbf{both}). 
			      In all cases the integration of the stream-lines ends at the true borders of a block or if 
			      a region of zero velocity is reached.\\
\hline
        whatout & Choice &    Selection of the scalar magnitude for output: the magnitude of the velocity field,
                              a single component of it, a number constant along a trajectory but different
                              for the different trajectories or the time along the trajectories.\\
\hline
        cellfr & Scalar & Each integration step advances the stream-line at least a fraction \textit{cellfr} of a cell in the grid.\\
\hline
        crit\_angle & Scalar & This parameter is only relevant for sets of grids. When a trajectory crosses
                               the interface between two grids, there may be a discontinuity of the velocity
                               field. If the angle of the vectors at both sides of the interface is larger
                               than the value of this parameter, the integration is interrupted. In this case
                               the presence of a wall is assumed. Nevertheless, if you want the integration
                               to continue even if the velocity field is strongly discontinuous, then you may set
                               this value to 90.\\
