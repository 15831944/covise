	{TensorScalMap}{covise/net/examples/TensorScal.net}{0.6}\end{covimg}

From \covlink{ReadPAM}{ReadPAM}{../../IO/ReadPAM/ReadPAM.html}
we may get the thickness and a tensor field describing the stress
states of shell elements. This tensor
field is not directly the stress, but forces per unit of length.
In order to get the average effective stress over
the thickness of the shells, we have to divide the output
of TensorScal by the thickness of the shells. This is done
by \covlink{Calc}{Calc}{../../Tools/Calc/Calc.html}.
The output for the last time step is produced below.
