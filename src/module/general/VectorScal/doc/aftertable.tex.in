Displaying vector lines for each grid point in a 3D volume often leads to very 
complex visualizations (see covise/net/tutorial/tutorial\_vel\_3.net). 
Therefore it is often clearer to display vector lines only on a surface, 
for example on the outer surface of the geometry or on a plane which cuts through 
the 3D data. In tutorial\_vel\_4.net the first RWCovise module reads in the 
computational grid of a channel with two inlets. The second RWCovise module 
reads in the velocity field. The module 
\covlink{CuttingSurface}{CuttingSurface}{../../Filter/CuttingSurface/CuttingSurface.html} 
extracts a plane with the velocity data on the plane. VectorField computes 
a vector arrow on each polygon vertex of the cutting surface. The module 
{\bf VectorScal} computes the amount of the velocity and the module Colors 
computes colors from the velocity amount data. The colors and the vector lines 
are combined with the module \covlink{Collect}{Collect}{../../Tools/Collect/Collect.html} 
and displayed in the Renderer.

Note: The tutorial net has been modified to show the use of VectorScal; in this special 
case you could have used the second output port of VectorField instead which
provides the scalar data anyway.
