\hline\hline
	gennormals & Boolean & Generation of surface normals. Since renderers often 
                                           have problems generating normals on the fly, 
                                           this option is recommended and TRUE by default. \\
\hline
	genstrips & Boolean & Generation of triangle strips. This option can be used to take 
                                           advantage of graphics hardware in the final rendering steps. 
                                           Default is TRUE.  \\
\hline
        isopoint  & Vector & Point determining the isosurface.\\
\hline
	isovalue & Boolean & The isovalue to be extracted from the data set.  
                                           The default value is 0.0.  \\
\hline
	autominmax & Boolean & -  \\
\hline
color\_or\_texture
&
Boolean
&
When true, the output Geometry object will have a an
object describing colors. Otherwise, it will contain
a texture.
\\
\hline
scale
&
Scalar
&
This parameter is relevant if you want to map
vector fields on your cutting surfaces. In this
case the vector field is represented by line
objects. Their length is controled with this
parameter (see parameter length below for further details).
\\
\hline
length
&
Choice
&
This is only relevant for vector data.
You have 2 options: either {\sl 1*scale} or {\sl length*scale}.
In the first one, all lines representing the vector field
are the same length, given by parameter scale. In the second one,
this scale is multiplied by the true length of the vector to
determine the length for the lines.
\\
\hline
num\_sectors
&
Scalar
&
This is only relevant for vector data. If you want
to better visualise the direction of the vector
field, you may wish to represent the output lines
as arrows. The complexity of these arrows may be
controled with this parameter. Do not be too greedy
using it, the higher it is, the bigger the output
object shall be.
