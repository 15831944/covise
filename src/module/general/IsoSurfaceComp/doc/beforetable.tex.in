% short description what the module does
%
The IsoSurfaceComp module creates an isosurface from a three 
dimensional structured and unstructured grid-based data mapped
on this isosurface
using the marching cubes algorithm. This module provides
all functionalities of IsoSurface, but has an important
advantage. You may considerably simplify your maps by
using IsoSurfaceComp, because you may connect directly
its first output port with a renderer, thereby relieving
yourself from the burden of using Collect, Colors, VectorField, etc.
%Optionally given data input can be mapped on the generated surface using
%interpolation. Each input port also accepts Sets of the appropriate types.
