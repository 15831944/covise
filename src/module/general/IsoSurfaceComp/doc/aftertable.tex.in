The first example network shows an isosurface generation 
using data from the GenDat module. A scalar field and a vector
field are generated. IsoSurfaceComp creates isosurfaces for
a given value of the scalar field. We map the vector field
on the output geometry using colored lines. This task would
require more modules if we had use the IsoSurface module instead.

You find the map in the directory {\bf covise/net/general/examples}.  

The next image is a snapshot of the results in the Inventor Renderer.

\subsubsection{Tunable Parameters}
%=============================================================
%
The Isosurface(Comp) module algorithm for unstructured grids has to
allocate memory for the output vertices and the data interpolated
on it. The size of this allocation is based on heuristics and
by default set to 20\% of the number of vertices in the input
data set. However, this might not be enough for some data sets,
especially if the Isosurface is extremely wrinkled.

In this case, the module terminates execution, submits a message,
increases the ratio by 5\% and re-executes itself. To prevent
this procedure, establish a higher starting value by putting
a section with a higher value (e.g. 50\%) into your covise.config:

\begin{verbatim}
IsosurfaceSurface
{
   # Ratio of array size to number of input vertices in Percent
   VERTEX_RATIO   50
}
\end{verbatim}

This value is used by both IsoSurface and IsoSurfaceComp. The
theoretical maximum value is 300\% (VERTEX\_RATIO 300).
