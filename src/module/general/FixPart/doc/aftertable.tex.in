We use the example of an airbag simulation which you can find 
in {\tt covise/net/examples/Dyna3D.net}. In this simulation the steering wheel 
does not move and the head of a person is moving towards the airbag. 
We add to the original map a new branch in which we use the module FixPart (see
figure). 

In this example map we fixed the partID nine which refers to the grid 
displaying the head of the person. The result is a simulation in which the 
steering wheel is moving to the head of the person and not the other way around 
as in the original data set. You see the original simulation in Renderer2 and 
the transformed simulation in Renderer1.
