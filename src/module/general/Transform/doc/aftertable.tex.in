Suppose we have a symmetrical object.
 
% examples for using this module
\begin{covimg}{}
{TransformRenderer}{One half of the object}{0.7}\end{covimg}

We use Transform in the map covise/net/examples/Transform.net to construct the 
whole object.

\begin{covimg}{}
	{TransformMap}{covise/net/examples/Transform.net}{0.6}\end{covimg}

RWCovise\_1 reads in the computational grid of a channel with two
inlets. RWCovise\_2 reads in the data on the surface.
DomainSurface computes the outer surface of the channel.
CutGeometry cuts away one half of the channel. You can see the result in Renderer2. 
The first figure shows you a screenshot of the original (half) object with wireframes. 
Transform mirrors the object and its data. The mirror plane is described by the 
normal vector (0,0,1). The origin is on the mirror plane. Colors translates the 
data into colors. 

The second figure shows the whole channel in the renderer. Both the
original non-mirrored and mirrored geometries are shown because
the value of parameter {\sl MirroredAndOriginal} is {\sl true}.

\begin{covimg}{}
  {TransformRendererMirrored}{Result in the renderer}{0.7}\end{covimg}

In the next example we illustrate the use of tiling. In this case
we are using the flipping option. The first renderer snapshot shows
the effect on a normal vector field. Note that we perform
the tiling by mirroring. The second image shows the result
if the input vector field is assumed to be a field of displacements.

\begin{covimg}{}
	{TransformTileMap}{covise/net/examples/TransformTile.net}{0.6}\end{covimg}

\begin{covimg}{}
  {TransformTileNormal}{Tiling a normal vector field}{0.7}\end{covimg}

\begin{covimg}{}
  {TransformTileDisplacements}{Tiling a displacements vector field}{0.7}\end{covimg}
