In the example below GridSurface has been used as a replacement for DomainSurface in 
covise/net/tutorial/tutorial\_grid\_1.net

\begin{covimg2}{}{GridSurfaceMap}{0.7}\end{covimg2}

The output in the Renderer is shown in the next picture; the option 'AutoClipping
Planes' in the Renderer Preference Sheet has been used to cut the object and thus show
the difference between GridSurface and DomainSurface.

\begin{covimg2}	{}{GridSurfaceRenderer}{0.6}\end{covimg2}
