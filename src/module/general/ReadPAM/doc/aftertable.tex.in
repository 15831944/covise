\subsubsection{Additional remarks}
%=============================================================
This module may fail to read one-dimensional elements
for files generated with solvers older than version 96.

Some variables of some one-dimensional elements may be
vectors defined in the global coordinate reference system
or in a local one. In the first case the label for this
variable in the choice lists will be terminated with gVEC;
in the latter case, with lVEC. 

In order to help you 
identify which kind of element some particular variable
is defined for in the case of some exotic one-dimensional elements,
we include in the termination of the variable title between
parenthesis the following tags:
\begin{itemize}
\item
bar1 stands for bar with material 205.
\item
sphJ stands for spherical joint.
\item
ftJ stands for flexion-torsion joint.
\item
sptW stands for spotwelds.
\item
kJ stands for kinematic joint.
\item
MIS stands for mesh-independent spotweld.
\end{itemize}
Other abbreviations should be clear.

\subsubsection{Examples}
%=============================================================

We present below two examples. 

\begin{covimg}{}
		{ReadPAM_map}{covise/net/examples/ReadPAM.net}{0.7}\end{covimg}
The model of the first example
uses three kinds of elements: shells, bars and mesh-independent
spotwelds. We plot in the three renderers the following magnitudes:
velocity per node, shell thickness and axial bar force. Note the
use of \covlink{SplitUsg}{SplitUsg}{../../Filter/SplitUsg/SplitUsg.html}
to realise the separation of elements of different dimensionality.
Other modules that you may find useful when trying to visualise
some parts of your model are
\covlink{AssembleUsg}{AssembleUsg}{../../Tools/AssembleUsg/AssembleUsg.html},
\covlink{CropUsg}{CropUsg}{../../Tools/CropUsg/CropUsg.html},
\covlink{PartSelect}{PartSelect}{../../Tools/PartSelect/PartSelect.html} and
\covlink{ClipInterval}{ClipInterval}{../../Filter/ClipInterval/ClipInterval.html}.
Below we produce the renderer output of the shell thickness.

\begin{covimg}{}
		{ReadPAM_frame}{Shell thickness}{0.7}\end{covimg}

\begin{covimg}{}
		{ReadPAM1_map}{covise/net/examples/ReadPAM1.net}{0.7}\end{covimg}
The model of the second example uses shells and tool elements.
With this example we illustrate the visuallisation of
non-local variables. We read file for the simulation
of a multichambered airbag. We need in this case the modules
\covlink{MakePlots}{MakePlots}{../../Tools/MakePlots/MakePlots.html} and
\covlink{Plot}{Plot}{../../Renderer/Plot/Plot.html}.
The Plot output for the temperatures in one of the airbag chambers
is produced below.

\begin{covimg}{}
		{ReadPAM_airbag}{Temperature in one airbag chamber}{0.45}\end{covimg}


%The above figure shows a map that performs reading the displaced FE meshes 
%together with scalar state data. The following module \covlink
%{DomainSurface}{DomainSurface}{../../Tools/DomainSurface/DomainSurface.html}
%is applied to generate a surface polygon of the data-set.

%The last figure is a snapshot of the renderer. It shows one step of an 
%airbag visualization.
