\begin{longtable}{|p{2.5cm}|p{4cm}|p{7cm}|}
\hline
   \bf{Name} & \bf{Type} & \bf{Description} \endhead
\hline\hline
	DSY\_file & File Browser & DSY file (used mainly for visualisation). \\
\hline
	THP\_file  & File Browser & THP file (used mainly for global or
        non-local data).\\ 
\hline
	scale & Scalar & You may modify the default valule (1.0)
        in order to amplify or suppress the deformation of the grid. \\
\hline
	timeSteps & Vector & When you set a DSY file, the components
        of this vector are automatically set with some default values:
        the first component is the initial time step for visualisation,
        and its default value is 1; the second component is the final
        time step for visualisation and its default value is the
        number of time steps that have been stored in the file; with the third
        component you may jump between time steps, the default
        value is 1, which means that all time steps between the first
        and the last one that you wish to visualise are read, a value
        of 2 means that only every second time step is read, and so forth.
        The time step indicated by the first component is always read in. \\
\hline
	Nodal\_Var1\newline 
	Nodal\_Var2 & Choice & Selection of nodal
        magnitude. \\ 
\hline
	Cell\_Var1\newline 
	Cell\_Var2 & Choice & Selection of element-based
        magnitude. \\ 
\hline
	DSY\_or\_THP & Boolean & This is only relevant for global variables.
        When this switch is true, then global variables are read from
        the DSY file. When it is false, from the THP file.\\
\hline
	Global\_Var1\ldots\newline Global\_Var6  & Choice & Selection of non-local 
        variables. These data are not intended for visualisation with
        a renderer, but with the \covlink{Plot}{Plot}{../../Renderer/Plot/Plot.html}
        module.\\ 
\hline
        Port select & switch & You may output tensor objects out
        of cell-based fields. In order to do that you activate
        one of the options: {\it Tensor port 1} or {\it Tensor port 2}.
        Then there will appear on the control panel a list of 9
        choice parameters for a maximum of 9 components. You may
        produce tensors of 4 types: symmetric 2D (3 independent
        components), full 2D (4 independent components), symmetric 3D
        (6 independent components) and full 3D (9 independnet components).
        For the 2D cases only the XX, XY, YX, and YY are relevant.
        If you want to produce a symmetric tensor, it is not necessary
        to repeat a redundant component. \\
\hline
	T1\_Component\_XX\ldots\newline T1\_Component\_ZZ & Choice & See
        parameter {\it Port select}. These are the components
        for the object of the first tensor port. \\
\hline
	T2\_Component\_XX\ldots\newline T2\_Component\_ZZ & Choice & See
        parameter {\it Port select}. These are the components
        for the object of the second tensor port. \\
