	data for sdata1\_2D(3D) & Choice & Name of scalar variable like 
	                           as given by case file - \newline
				   only visible after case file is given

	data\_byte\_swap & Boolean & Choose to explicitly enfore byte-swapping \\
\hline
	choose\_parts & String & String for the selection of parts. The syntax is explained below. \\
\hline
	repair\_connectivity & Boolean & Experimental parameter to controll the removal of degenerated cells. In most cases faulty grids arise but it may be usefull for the output of VECTIS\copyright \\
\hline
	store\_covgrp & Boolean & Controlls the generation of a COVISE project. A directory covise-ensight is created. It contains all covise-binary formatted data and a covise-group file. This output can be loaded with the module {\bf ReadCoviseGroup}. \\

{\bf Syntax for the part selection string}

\begin{longtable}{p{3cm}p{15cm}}
	all      & All ENSIGHT-parts are read. This is the default.\\
        x-y      & All parts starting frm part x to part y are read.\\
	x,y,z,.. & Part x, part y, part z, .. are read
\end{longtable}

The counting scheme of parts corresponds to the table which appears in the COVISE log window.
All options, but {\it all} may be combined with {\bf ,}.
