Write any type of vtk dataset to file.

 vtkDataSetWriter is an abstract class for mapper objects that write their 
 data to disk (or into a communications port). The input to this object is
 a dataset of any type.


This module (including its documentation) was auto-generated and provides the functionality of the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) class vtkDataSetWriter.
