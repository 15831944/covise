	length & Choice & With this parameter the length of the lines can be set.\newline
	{\it 1*scale} scales all lines with the value of the {\it scale} parameter.
	\newline
	{\it length*scale} means that the amount of the vector is used to compute
	the length which is then multiplied with {\it scale}.\newline
	{\it according\_to\_data} scales the lines according to the data from the
	optional input port.\\
\hline
	scale & Slider & Scale factor which is used when length is set to {\it
	1*scale} or {\it length*scale}.  \\
\hline
	fasten & Choice & Point where the vector lines are fastened. Default is {\it
	on\_the\_bottom} which means, that the lines start at the grid/surface
	vertices. {\it on\_the\_middle} means that the middle of the line is
	fastened at the grid/surface vertices.\\														
\hline
        num\_sectors & Scalar & arrow head is built using num\_sectors lines - 
	If you have difficulties in identifying
        the direction of the vector, you may introduce here a positive
        value in order to give all vectors an arrow point. This value
        parametrises the refinement of the graphical representation
        for the arrow points. In general values of an order of magnitude
        between 1 and 30 have to be enough for your purposes. \\
