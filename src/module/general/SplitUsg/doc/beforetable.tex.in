% short description what the module does
%
The input to this module is an unstructured  grid (or set of grids) and 
maybe scalar or vector data (node or element centred). It constructs output grids
with the criterion that they have a well-defined
dimensionality, thus obtaining an object which contains all 3D
elements, another one with all 2D elements, and 1D and 0D respectively, i. e. 
simply speaking SplitUsg separates the incoming grid into points, lines, plygons, etc..
The scalar or vector data is separated accordingly.

% input of a module icon for example
% #1	path for eps
% #2  picture name
% #3  scale factor
\begin{covimg2}{}{splitusg}{0.7}\end{covimg2}
