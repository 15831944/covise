With the module GenDat we create a simple structured data set. On the one hand we display 
the data values on a cutting line by colors. Therefore we use the module FilterCrop 
to extract one line out of the structured grid. You can see the resulting points and 
their data values visualised by colors in the first image. To reproduce the same image 
as shown in the example docu, use the draw option {\tt points} in the renderer or insert the module
'Sphere' between ShowGrid and Collect to make points visible. More 
over go to the Colormaps window in the information area of the renderer and click 
on Collect\_1\_OUT to get the colormap displayed in your renderer window to see 
the scaling. 
\\
One the other hand we use the module CuttingLine to dislay the same values as a 2D plot. The result is shown in the second image. On the x-axis of the plot you can find the used index range, here from zero to eight.
