\hline
   \bf{Name} & \bf{Type} & \bf{Description} \endhead
\hline\hline
	no\_startp & Slider & Starting point selection: see below \\
\hline
	startpoint1 & Vector & Starting point selection: see below \\
\hline
        startpoint2 & Vector & Starting point selection: see below \\
\hline
        direction   & Vector & Starting plane direction: see below \\
\hline
        Displacement & Vector & Constant offset added to all lines \\
\hline
        tdirection & Choice & Trace direction: Forward, Backward, Both \\
\hline	
	whatout & Choice & mag / v\_x v\_y v\_z / time \\
\hline
        taskType & Choice & select between Moving Points, Stream-,
		                                    Streak- or Pathlines      \\
\hline	
	startStyle & Choice & line or plane \\				    
\hline	
	trace\_eps & Scalar & Finetuning parameter for Trace integration 
				{\small (Maximum permitted relative error per integration
        			step. This parameter is involved in the control of the 
        			integration step.)} \\	
\hline	
	trace\_abs & Scalar & Finetuning parameter for Trace integration 
			{\small (Maximum permitted absolute error per integration
        		step. This parameter is involved in the control of the 
        		integration step.)}\\	
\hline	
	grid\_tol & Scalar & Tolerance value for grids with gaps \\
\hline	 
	trace\_len & Scalar &  Finetuning parameter for Trace integration 
				{\small (Maximum length for streamlines.)}\\
\hline	
	min\_vel & Scalar &  Finetuning parameter for Trace integration 
		{\small (Minimum velocity for streamlines.
        	If along the integration of a streamline, the velocity is found
        	to be smaller than this value, the integration is interrupted.)}  \\	
\hline	
	MaxPoints & Scalar & Number of Steps for Moving Points	\\
\hline	
	stepDuration & Scalar & Time stepping used in transient traces and for 
	                               moving points	\\
\hline	
	NoCycles & Scalar & For transient cases: repeat input steps	    \\		    
\hline	
	NoInterpolation	& Boolean & Finetuning parameter for Trace integration 
	{\small (This parameter is only relevant for 
        moving points or pathlines
        with static data. The default value is false. This means that the
        last point of the pathlines, if you have chosen this option
        in the parameter "taskType", or the points you see, in the case of moving
        points, have been evaluated by an interpolation between two consecutive
        points of a calculated streamline. This is faster than the true
        option, especially if stepDuration is very small. In the case true,
        the step control of the integration is disturbed in a way that
        it is forced to calculate values for the times we need for output.
        The true case is only recommended for rather large values
        of the stepDuration parameter, otherwise the performance penalty
        may be important. In most cases the default false value is preferable.)} \\
\hline	
	ThrowNewParticles & Boolean & Throw new particles in multiple timesteps	 \\		    	    
\hline
	ParticlesReleaseRate &	Scalar & Frequency at which new particles are released \\
\hline	
	divideCell & Scalar & Finetuning parameter for Trace integration 
		{\small (This parameters sets the integration
        	step when the integrator has detected that the particle is
        	not far from a wall (the border of a grid), 
        	so that the distance covered by the particle
        	in a time step is approximately the value of this parameter
        	multiplied by a cell typical distance. This number should always
        	be positive.)}\\
\hline
	maxOutOfDomain	& Scalar & Follow particles out of cell 
	- increase if grid has gaps the particles should fly through \\
\hline
        NoWThreads & Scalar & Multi-Threading: 0 means single-thread \\
\hline
	SearchLevel & Scalar &	 Search depth for polygon tracing starting points.
                           Increase when staring points are not found \\  			
\hline
        SkipInitialSteps & Scalar & This is relevant on dynamic data sets for pathlines, moving points and streaklines. You may control with this parameter the
initial step at which particles are released. \\
%% \hline
%%         SphereRadius & Scalar & This is only available in the {\sl complex 
%%         version of the module}, TracerComp. In this case you may control
%%         the particle size when producing animation of type {\sl moving points}.\\
\hline
	color & String & The color of the streamlines. \\
\hline
