% short description what the module does
%

The Tracer module performs particle tracing within vector fields.
It can either show {\bf Floating Particles} or connect these to {\bf Streamlines},
{\bf Streaklines}, and {\bf Pathlines}, which are different for transient data.
(For enhanced functions see TracerComp.)

The data can be given on structured and unstructured grids and also
on Polygons. If the data is given on Polygons, the traces are bound
to the polygons even if the velocities have components pointing out
of it. The Polygons do not have to be planar.

Starting points can be given equally spaced on either a line or a
rectangular area in 3D space, either by numerical input or interactive
by VR manipulators in COVER.
