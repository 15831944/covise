% short description what the module does
%
Sample resamples point-based, uniform or unstructured data to a uniform grid.

%
% input of a module icon for example
% #1	path for eps
% #2  picture name
% #3  scale factor
\begin{covimg2}{}{SampleModule}{0.7}\end{covimg2}

Data cells in the destination uniform grid that are not intersected
by the input data are either
set to a certain value or the maximum float value (see parameter outside). 
The module \covlink {Colors}{Colors}{../../Color/Colors/Colors.html} computes a
transparent color for MAX\_FLT data, so that those parts appear transparent in the COVER. If you use
the Inventor Renderer set the value fill\_value to a value which is in the range of your data set. In this case you will have to activate
one of the `blended' modes of the Inventor Renderer under the `Viewing' item
of the menu bar.

A uniform grid and colors on the uniform grid can also be seen as a 3D texture. If
you cut a plane out of the 3D texture you get a 2D texture (an image). Mapping this
texture on a plane gives similar information as a cuttingsurface through the 3D grid
with data mapped on the surface as colors.
Volume rendering can be used to display the data on all the uniform grid at once.

3D textures are supported by Octane and Onyx systems as well as
Nvidia Geforce/Quadro 4 or newer and are computed by the
graphics hardware and are thus very fast.
