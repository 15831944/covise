\hline\hline
	data\_path & File Browser & LS-DYNA plot file location (Version LS 930). \\
\hline
	nodalDataType & Choice & Select the type if additionally nodal results data 
	should be read like either displacements, velocities, or accelerations.\\
\hline
	elementDataType & Choice & Select the type if additionally element 
	results data should be read like either components of the stress tensor 
	or the plastic strain.  \\
\hline
	component & Choice & Select the component of the stress tensor 
	[Sxx, Syy, Szz, Txy, Tyz, Txz ]. You may also select the pressure
        (defined as \latexonly $-\frac{{\rm Tr}\  \sigma}{3}$ \endlatexonly
	\begin{htmlonly} - Tr sigma / 3 \end{htmlonly}, where 
        \latexonly ${\rm Tr}\  \sigma $ \endlatexonly 
	\begin{htmlonly} Tr sigma \end{htmlonly} stands
        for the trace of the stress tensor) or the Von Mises stress.
        {\it Only relevant if chosen 
	"stress tensor" as data type of the second data port.}  \\
\hline
	Selection & String & Select parts by ID numbers, e.g. "2-5,10-13". 
	The material number of the Finite Elements in the plot file defines 
	the different parts in COVISE.  \\
\hline
	Min\_Num\_State & Vector & Select the timestep interval. 
        %Timesteps are numbered from 1 to number of steps. 
        The components of the vector
        determine the minimum and number of time steps that are read in.
        The second component is the number of
        time steps that will be read (without counting the first one).
        %at most (the real number may
        %be reduced if the third component is lower than the second).
        If the first component is 1, the first time step to be
        read is the first available time step. If it is
        greater than 1, then the first time step to be read depends
        on how many time steps have been saved per file.
        %The third component sets an additional limit that may override
        %the value of the second component, but normally you will
        %want it to coincide with the second component. 
        \\
\hline
	format & Choice & Select the special format of the plot file. 
	In CADFEM format all numbers, characters, etc are written as 
	real numbers. In the original US format they are written as it 
	should be.\\
\hline
	only geometry & Boolean & If set TRUE only the geometry and 
	topology section are read, i.e. no state data.  \\
