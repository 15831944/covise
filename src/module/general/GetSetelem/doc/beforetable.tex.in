The ports are "symmetric". One port (you may select the first one) allows you to 
perform this operation for a set of unstructured grids (or a tree-like set structure, 
the leaves of which are grids). The other ports have a similar functionality, but
work with unstructured data (scalar or vector) objects instead of unstructured grids.
