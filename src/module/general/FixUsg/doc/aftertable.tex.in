\begin{covimg2} {}{FixUsgMap}{0.7}\end{covimg2}
%
The figure above shows a map that illustrates usage of FixUsg. (The Renderer module has been
added to the example map, so you can control the operation of FixUsg both in the Renderer
window and in the Message area.) 
Many readers don't care about using the same coordinate twice or not using it at all. 
But some modules expect such "clean data" for computational reasons. Therefore you should 
try to use FixUsg if you have a strange behaviour of a module.  \\
In this example we use the NASTRAN reader. The reader itself does't check the received data. 
With FixUsg we can remove 220 points. \\
Hints for using the renderer (see next picture): Use "Edit Background Color" to improve the visibility of the
remaining points. If you set delta = 1 and maxvertices = 0 1,2,3,4,5,... you can follow up the
reduction of points. \\
