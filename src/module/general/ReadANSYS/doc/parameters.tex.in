\hline
   \bf{Name} & \bf{Type} & \bf{Description} \endhead
\hline\hline
	RST\_file & File Browser & Name of .rst .rfl or .rth file. \\
\hline
	timeSteps  & Vector & First set, last set and a number used for skipping sets.\\
\hline
	ScaleGridDisplacements & Scalar & You may modify the default valule (1.0)
        in order to amplify or suppress the deformation of the grid. \\
\hline
	Solution & Choice & You should choose among 3 options: showing only
        a frozen geometry not influenced by parameter {\sl timeSteps}, or nodal
        data (degrees of freedom) or element data (derived results). 
        The two latter options are influenced by the value of {\sl timeSteps}. \\ 
\hline
	DOF\_Solution & Choice & The module sets up a list with the degrees of freedom
        available in the file. The module may also include options for generating
        vector magnitudes out of these degrees of freedom. This happens if
        the 3 components are found in the file. The isolated components are output
        in the nodal coordinate system used in the analysis. However, when
        you choose oone vector option, the resulting vector field will be rotated
        into the global coordinate system.\\
\hline
	Derived\_Solution & Choice & You may choose among stresses, elastic strains,
        plastic strains, creep strains, thermal strains, thermal fluxes and
        volume or energy-related data per cell.\\
\hline
	SolidShellComponents  & Choice & The value of this selection
        influences the magnitude associated with solid elements and
        shells. You may choose among XX, YY, ZZ, XY, YZ, ZX, T1, T2, T3,
        TI and TIGE. The first 6 valid choices determine the component of the
        relevant symmetric tensor (chosen through {\sl Derived\_Solution})
        selected for output. T1, T2, T3 stand for principal values of the tensor
        and are only available for stresses. TI stands for the intensity
        as defined in the ANSYS manuals and is only available for stresses.
        TIGE stands for the equivalent value and is available in principle for
        stresses and strains. If you want to compare the results
        produced by choosing one of the possible components with the images
        of the ANSYS postprocessor, you will have to introduce the APDL
        command {\sl rsys, solu}, which makes ANSYS show results in the
        same coordinate system as used for their being saved in the results file.\\
\hline
	BeamComponents  & Choice & You may choose among the axial, Yp, Ym,
        Zp, Zm options. Stresses or strains for beam elements are referred to
        an element coordinate system whose X component is aligned with the beam.
        Yp, Ym (Zp, Zm) refer to the state at the positive and negative side respectively
        along the local Y (Z) direction.\\
\hline
        AxiShellComponents & Choice & For axisymmteric shells the available
        components are not the ones listed by {\sl SolidShellComponents}, but
        Meridional, ThroughThickness, Hoop and Meridional--hoop.\\
\hline
        TopBottom & Choice & For shells you may select if the data is shown
        for the top or the bottom side. You may also choose to average both results.
        For multilayered shells you might see false results, if keyopt(8) is 1.\\	
\hline
        ThermalFlux & Choice & You may choose among the 3 independent components
        of the the heat flux, or choose the vector itself.\\
\hline
        VolEnergy & Choice & You may select volume, strain enery or kinetic 
        energy per cell.\\
\hline
        OutputNodeDecode & Boolean & for special applications only - not
	recommended \\  
\hline
        AlwaysVertexBased & Boolean & if turned on cell based data is automatically 
	       converted to vertex based data \\	      
\hline
        MagFluxDens & Choice & For electromagnetical applications only! Choose the component of the magnetical flux-density to be read. \\
