This is a module to read ASCII files to create points (with or without scalar or vector values) or a grid. It is created to handle all (senseful) types of formats. So there are very many parameters, to fit as many formats as possible.\\
{\bf It is strongly recommended to use the Control Panel instead the Module Parameter list}, because the module maps the available parameters dynamically to the  Control Panel. Due to that, you don't have to worry about parameters that have no influence to the reading process.\\
The most importent parameter is the {\bf data format}, because the modul reads the file with help from this parameter.\newline
There are different examples below.
