\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Set of Elements}

\begin{covimg}
{}{BlockCollectMap}{covise/net/examples/BlockCollect.net}{0.7}\end{covimg}

We always want to cut the surface and the outer lines of an object with the same cutting plane.
Therefore we put these two objects into one set and use just one module CutGeometry.

\begin{covimg}
{}{BlockCollectOut1}{Renderer output}{0.7}\end{covimg}
\clearpage

\item {\bf Cat Timesteps} 

\begin{covimg}
{}{BlockCollect_CatTimesteps}{covise/net/examples/BlockCollect\_CatTimesteps.net}{0.7}\end{covimg}

We want to create a series of time steps using single objects. In this example we create a set of 
rotated objects with the module Transform, here we rotate the object 35 times by 10 degrees. With the module 
BlockCollect we reorganize the output so that we get one rotation per time step. More over we add the original
object at the second input port to complete a cyclic time series.

{}{BlockCollectOut2}{Renderer output (Cat Timesteps)}{0.7}\end{covimg}

\item {\bf Merge Blocks}

\begin{covimg}
{}{BlockCollect_MergeBlocks}{covise/net/examples/BlockCollect\_MergeBlocks.net}{0.7}\end{covimg}

We know visualise two case studies of the example described in section "Cat Timesteps". We create the same 
rotation and map on the one hand temperature and on the other hand pressure on the surface. To split
the two case we use the first Transform module in the right pipeline to translate the output of this
pipeline.
The first level of BlockCollect modules uses the mode "Merge Blocks" to tell COVISE that the first rotation
of the left pipeline and the first rotation of the right pipeline belong to each other.
The second level of BlockCollect modules creates a series of time steps with the mode "Cat Timesteps".
We have to use two modules BlockCollect in every level because COVISE handles the geometry and the mapped 
data on it independently.
