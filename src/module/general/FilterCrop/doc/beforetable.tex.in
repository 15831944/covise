% short description what the module does
%
FilterCrop allows to reduce the number of grid lines in structured grids. 

% input of a module icon for example
% #1	path for eps
% #2  picture name
% #3  scale factor
\begin{covimg2}{}{FilterCrop}{0.7}\end{covimg2}

FilterCrop can either crop the index space of a grid by chosing min and max indices 
different from 0 and the initial max value, by simply omitting all grid points 
that lie outside this interval (this is independent for all three coordinate axes).
The other possibility is to use the sample parameter to skip a certain number 
of intermediate grid points (this is the same value for all three directions). 
A sample of 2 (the default) means that every second grid point will
be displayed, in the case of 3 every third grid point and so on.\\
