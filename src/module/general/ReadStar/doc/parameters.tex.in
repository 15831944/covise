   \hline\hline
	   mesh\_path & Browser & StarCD mesh file (*16/*mdl) location: Input file with
					     mesh information. 

					     If a restart file (*09/*pst) from a moving-grid simulation
					     is visualized, the mesh file (*16/*mdl) must be created for
					     the specific step. This is not needed if the transient output
					     file (*29/*pstt) is used. 

					     Immediately after the mesh file was selected, {\bf ReadStar}
					     starts reading the file to gain information. This might take
					     some time for large data sets. \\
   \hline
	   data\_path &Browser & StarCD result file (*09/*pst or *29/*pstt) location: Input
					     file with result data. 

					     Immediately after the result file was selected, {\bf ReadStar}
					     starts reading the file to gain information. This might take
					     some time for large data sets. As soon as a valid
					     combination of mesh and data files are found, the mesh
					     file is scanned for the names of the scalar values and the
					     data file (if transient) is scanned for the number of
					     time-steps. Then parameters field\_0,...field\_15 are
					     updated and you can select now the data you want to have
					     at the corresponding output ports.  \\
														   
   \hline
	   from\_to\_step & Integer vector & Time-steps to be read: First step, last step, increment.
					     Time-steps are numbered from 1 (1st step in file) to
					     number of steps, NOT in Star-CD internal numbering. \\
   \hline
   timestep& Slider & not yet used \\
   \hline
   cellVert& Choice & Select the data output format: data per vertex or data per cell. Default selection: vertex
						   based data. 

						   If you select cell based data you have to use the module 
														   CellToVert to convert them to
						   vertex based data because the following post-processing modules (IsoSurface,
					     CuttingSurface, Tracer) support only vertex based data. \\
   \hline
   field\_0 ,...\newline
   field\_15 & Choice & Select which data field to read for the output ports "data\_0,...,
														   data\_15". This choice is
					     updated after reading the input files. The value "---" means that no data is sent to
					     Port "data\_x". \\
   \hline
