\subsubsection{Examples}
%=============================================================
%
The first example map has been generated by modifying an existing map that showed
stationary pressure data: MakeTransient generates the geometry for the specified 
number of timesteps and Interpolate generates the corresponding pressure data, shown as
colors; in this case, please make sure that both use the same number of steps.

The second example shows you, how to use the second (optional) input port of 
MakeTransient to get the right number of steps according to the first output port of
Interpolate.

The Renderer picture contains the Timestep Sequencer generated by MakeTransient.
