\begin{covimg}

We modified the map {covise/net/examples/ReadANSYS\_flow.net}. We collect the surface and
the mapped data on it with the module PipelineCollect. The pipeline is executed three times because
the output of the ReadANSYS module contains three time steps. The module GetSetelem delivers one step after
the other.

Note: You have to put the module PipelineCollect always in front of the module Collect.
