   \bf{Name} & \bf{Type} & \bf{Description} \endhead
\hline\hline
	RST\_file & Browser & The path of a TIFF file.\\
\hline
	ImageSize & Choice & This parameter adjusts the size of
        the image relative to the size of the geometric object.
        The image is taken to be a rectangle on the XY plane.
        You may manually adjust the image size with other parameters,
        or tell the module to adjust the image size to the projection
        of the geometry bounding box onto the XY plane. The third
        option reads in the geometrical hints contained in the TIFF file
        in centimeters.\\
\hline
	ImageOrientation & Choice & The {\sl Free} option means that the
        resulting orientation is that which minimises shear strains
        of the image. {\sl Portrait} and {\sl Landscape} have the usual 
        meaning assuming the Y axis is vertical and the X one horizontal.\\
\hline
	PhysimageW & Scalar & X image dimension. This parameter is active
        if in {\sl ImageSize} you have selected manual image size adjustment.\\
\hline
	PhysimageH & Scalar & Y image dimension. This parameter is active
        if in {\sl ImageSize} you have selected manual image size adjustment.\\
\hline
	XPixelImageSize & Scalar & Texture pixel resolution in the X direction. 
	                          Has to be a power of two if you use COVER later. \\
\hline
	YPixelImageSize & Scalar & Texture pixel resolution in the Y direction.
	                          Has to be a power of two if you use COVER later.\\
\hline
	GroupGeometry & Boolean & This parameter is only relevant if the input
        geometry is structured with a set of several polygon objects. If the
        value is true, then the module will not generate an image of each
        polygon object; put it another way, you will see a single image 
        for the whole set of objects. \\
\hline
	MirrorImage & Boolean & This parameter is relevant if the image
        is smaller than the geometry. In this case we have to continue
        somehow the image by some sort of tessellation. If the value is true,
        then additional
        images are alternatively flipped.\\
