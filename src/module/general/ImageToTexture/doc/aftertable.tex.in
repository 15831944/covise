%\paragraph{First example}
%
\begin{covimg}{}%
		{ImageToTextureMap1}{covise/net/examples/ImageToTexture.net}{0.6}\end{covimg}

In the first example we show a dynamic geometry. As the geometry moves the image 
moves with it. In order to achieve this effect, we use the displacement information
at the second port.

\begin{covimg}{}%
		{ImageToTextureRend1}{The image is dragged by the material motion.}{0.6}\end{covimg}

\begin{covimg}{}%
		{ImageToTextureMap2}{covise/net/examples/ImageToTexture2.net}{0.6}\end{covimg}

In the second example we want to illustrate the effect of the parameter {\sl GroupGeometry}
and of size adjustment. The geometry is a set with 4 Polygon object. When
the value of {\sl GroupGeometry} is true (default), the image is mapped once onto the
whole geometry. This effect is seen in the first renderer image. If the value
of this parameter is false, then we get the second image. Note that here the geometry
is used separately for each Polygon object. The third image has the default
value for this parameter, i.e. true. If we are seeing here many eyes, it is because
we are no longer fitting the image size to that of the geometry. In this case, we
have manually set the image size to an inferior value, that is why we have to replicate
the image in order to create a texture for the whole geometry.

\begin{covimg}{}%
		{ImageToTextureRend2_1}{GroupGeometry is true, the image size is that of the geometry.}{0.6}\end{covimg}

\begin{covimg}{}%
		{ImageToTextureRend2_2}{GroupGeometry is false.}{0.6}\end{covimg}

\begin{covimg}{}%
		{ImageToTextureRend2_3}{GroupGeometry is true, but the image size has been manually adjusted to an inferior value.}{0.6}\end{covimg}

%The dimension of the sampled grid was 30x30x30 and the fill value of Sample
%was set to 0.0.
%
%The module \covlink 
%{CuttingSurface}{CuttingSurface}{../../Filter/CuttingSurface/CuttingSurface.html}
% computes a cuttingsurface on the uniform grid and the module 
%\covlink {Colors}{Colors}{../../Color/Colors/Colors.html} maps the
%data on the surface to colors.
%
%The module
%\covlink{ShowGrid}{ShowGrid}{../../Tools/ShowGrid/ShowGrid.html}
% displays the uniform grid (in this case 3 sides of the outer surface).
