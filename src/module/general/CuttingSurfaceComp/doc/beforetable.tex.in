% short description what the module does
%
The only difference between CuttingSurface and 
CuttingSurfaceComp is that CuttingSurfaceComp directly produces its output
for a Renderer. To get a colored output you have the possibility to 
pass a colormap by an input port. In general you will only connect
the first output port of the module directly with the renderer. 
Using this module instead
of CuttingSurface reduces the number of modules (Collect, Colors, VectorField...)
you have to use.

CuttingSurfaceComp implements now the functionality of
CuttingSurface3DTex, which should no longer be used.
More remarks to this point are found under {\sl examples}.
