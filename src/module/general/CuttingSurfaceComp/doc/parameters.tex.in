\begin{longtable}{|p{2.5cm}|p{4cm}|p{7cm}|}
\hline
\bf{Name} & \bf{Type} & \bf{Description} \endhead
\hline\hline
vertex 
& 
Vector 
&   
Normal of the plane, center of the sphere or one point on the axis of the cylinder.
\\
\hline
point 
& 
Vector 
&   
One point on the cutting surface.
\\
\hline
scalar
&
Scalar
&
Distance of the origin to the plane or radius of the sphere or cylinder.
% This would overdetermine the cylinder
% or radius of the
% cylinder.
\\
\hline
option
&
Choice
&
Select the shape of the surface: plane, sphere, cylinder-x, cylinder-y,
cylinder-z. cylinder-x means a cylinder with its axis in the direction of the
x axis.
\\
\hline
gennormals
&
Boolean
&
Toggle the generation of normals. By default the generation of normals is
turned off. The generated normals are available at the 3. output port named
normalsOut. this port has to be connected to the 3. input port of the module
Collect.
\\
\hline

genstrips
&
Boolean
&
Toggle the generation of triangle strips. By default the generation of triangle
strips is turned on.
\\
\hline
genDummyS
&
Boolean
&
Toggle the generation of a dummy surface if the cutting surface doesn't intersect the object. By default the generation of the dummy surface
strips is turned off.
\\
\hline
offset
&
Scalar
&
Specifies the hight, the isolines are lifted above the CuttingSurfaceComp. If you
don't specify an offset parts of the isolines can be occluded by the surface due
to the limited accuracy of the Z-buffer. If you specify negative offsets, the
lines appear on the backside of the plane respectively the inside of the sphere
or cylinder.
\\
\hline
numiso
&
Scalar
&
Specifies the number of isolines.
\\
\hline
isostart
&
Scalar
&
Initial value for isolines.
\\
\hline
isoend
&
Scalar
&
End value for isolines.
\\
\hline
color\_or\_texture
&
Boolean
&
When true, the output Geometry object will have a an
object describing colors. Otherwise, it will contain
a texture.
\\
\hline
scale
&
Scalar
&
This parameter is relevant if you want to map
vector fields on your cutting surfaces. In this
case the vector field is represented by line
objects. Their length is controled with this
parameter (see parameter length below for further details).
\\
\hline
length
&
Choice
&
This is only relevant for vector data.
You have 2 options: either {\sl 1*scale} or {\sl length*scale}.
In the first one, all lines representing the vector field
are the same length, given by parameter scale. In the second one,
this scale is multiplied by the true length of the vector to
determine the length for the lines.
\\
\hline
num\_sectors
&
Scalar
&
This is only relevant for vector data. If you want
to better visualise the direction of the vector
field, you may wish to represent the output lines
as arrows. The complexity of these arrows may be
controled with this parameter. Do not be too greedy
using it, the higher it is, the bigger the output
object shall be.
\\
\hline
vector
&
Choice
&
Determine the appearance of vector-data associated with the cutting surface.
Has an effect only when the input is vector-data. \\
\hline
&& { \bf OnlySurface: } Use the vector-length as scalar value.  Nothing more.\\
\hline
&&  { \bf OnlyLines: } Use lines.  Nothing more. \\
\hline
&&   { \bf SurfaceAndLines: }  Use vector-length and lines combined. \\
\hline
vertex\_ratio
&
Scalar
&
Percentage of grid used for memory allocation.  (See
\covlink{CuttingSurface}{CuttingSurface}{../../Filter/CuttingSurface/CuttingSurface.html} for more details.)
\\
