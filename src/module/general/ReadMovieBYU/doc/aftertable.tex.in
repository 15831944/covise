This is a simple example of a net using ReadMovieBYU. In this case displacement data is used, 
so only the second output port is needed. The small data set shows some timesteps of a small 
car crashing against a road plank.  
To edit the data set DomainSurface and GenNormals are choosen; they provide a smooth surface 
of the model. You can also take DisplaceUsg to get a result.  

The next image is a snapshot of the results in the Inventor Renderer.
