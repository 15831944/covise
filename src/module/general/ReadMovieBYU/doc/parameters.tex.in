\hline
   \bf{Name} & \bf{Type} & \bf{Description} \endhead
\hline\hline
	gridpath & File Browser & Required file path of the basic grid file.  \\
\hline
	datapath & File Browser & Scalar, vector or displacement data additional 
	to the grid file. The number of elements must match the number of nodes 
	in the grid.  \\
\hline
	colorpath & File Browser & Optional color path of the color file in ascii format. 
	If the grid has multiple parts each part gets a different color. 
	If you want to write a color file take the system colors of sgi and 
	write each in one line, save the file as ascii format. The system colors can 
	be found in /usr/share/X11/rgb.txt . Otherwise the default colors red, green and 
	blue are used.  \\
\hline
	filetype & Choice & Choice parameter for the file format. 
	At the moment only ascii is supported, fortran and binary format not.  \\
\hline
	gridtype & Choice & Choice parameter for the grid format. 
        % As far as I know MovieBYU 
	% has only unstructered grids, so you can only choose this.  \\
        You can only choose unstructured grids.\\
\hline
	datatype & Choice & Choice parameter for the optional data file. 
	You can choose scalar, vector or displacement data files. 
	Displacement data is automaticly computed by the module, scalar and vector 
	data is only transformed to Covise data, so you must handle them with 
	other modules to see an effect.  \\
\hline
	timesteps & Scalar & The number of timesteps that are computed by the module. 
	It has only an effect if datatype is displacement and a data file is chosen.  \\
\hline
	delta & Scalar & If timesteps are available you can skip particular steps 
	by setting this parameter greater one.  \\
