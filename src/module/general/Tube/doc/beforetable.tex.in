% short description what the module does
%
Tube creates cylinders around the lines. 
The shape of the tubes will be determined in function of the radius, 
number of sides (scalar parameters) and the type of the 
cylinder (open, closed or arrow).
When a diameter is provided at port three, each line is scaled by the appropriate value.
The Diameter is multiplied with the radius parameter value.
When the amount of data supplied is equal to the number of points of the line, the tube thickness is adjusted on a per point basis.
