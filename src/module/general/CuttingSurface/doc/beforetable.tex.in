% short description what the module does
%
CuttingSurface extracts surfaces of different shape 
(planes, cylinders, spheres) and can also map
isolines onto the plane. Linear interpolation is used 
to calculate the data values on the grid nodes of
the resulting cutting surface. 

Note: If you like colored output of CuttingSurface that you can connect directly to the
Renderer, see \covlink{CuttingSurfaceComp}{CuttingSurfaceComp}{../../Filter/CuttingSurfaceComp/CuttingSurfaceComp.html}
