\subsubsection{Tunable Parameter}
%=============================================================
%
The CuttingSurface module algorithm for unstructured grids has to
allocate memory for the output vertices and the data interpolated
on it. The size of this allocation is based on heuristics over several
data sets and defaults to
\begin{verbatim}
    max_vert = VERTEX_RATIO  * num_vert_in ^ (2/3)
    
    VERTEX_RATIO = 4.0   by default.
\end{verbatim}
However, this setting might be too low.
In this case, the module terminates execution, submits a message,
increases the ratio by 1.0 and re-executes itself. To prevent
this procedure, establish a higher starting value (e.g. 9.0) by
putting a section into your covise.config file:
\begin{verbatim}
CuttingSurface
{
   # Ratio of array size to number of input vertices in Percent
   VERTEX_RATIO   9.0
}
\end{verbatim}

% examples for using this module

Example 1 shows {\tt covise/net/tutorial\_pressure\_1.net}.

\begin{covimg}{}{CuttingSurfaceMap}{covise/net/tutorial\_pressure\_1.net}{0.6}\end{covimg}

RWCovise\_1 reads in the grid. The module DomainSurface computes the edges of the outer surface
of the grid and the module Renderer displays the edges as white lines. 

RWCovise\_2 reads in the pressure values on the grid points. CuttingSurface\_1 computes a cutting 
plane with the normal (0.0 0.0 1.0) and the distance (0.05). 

The module Colors\_2 is in the map only for creating a colormap with the minimum and maximum of
all pressure values.

The interpolated data on the cutting plane are mapped to colors with the module Colors\_1.  The module
Colors\_1 inherits the colormap and minimum and maximum from Colors\_2.

The module Collect creates triangle strips from the coordinates and the colors and the Renderer displays
the resulting plane as colored polygons.
