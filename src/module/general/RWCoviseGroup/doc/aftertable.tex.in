The first RWCoviseGroup reads the data in. We have four files: one for the grid data, 
one for the temperature data, one for the pressure data and one for the velocity data. 
The map uses the data to compute a cutting surface and some trace lines. In this example 
the temperature data is used for the cutting surface. But with RWCoviseGroup you can now 
visualize the pressure data without changing your map: Choose "pressure" for 
the field\_1 choice parameter which defines the output of the second output port and 
execute the pipeline again. You then get the result shown in the next picture. 

The second RWCoviseGroup modules is now in writing mode. You can choose your own 
description for the two connected ports.
