% General Notes for Latex novices:
% 1. Please protect any "_" by a backslash "\" to prevent that it is
%    interpreted by Latex as an order, e. g. write
%    Vec3. 
%    Protect "#", "$", "&", "%" , "{" and "}" in the same way by a "\".
% 2. Use {\bf text} or {\it text} to generate text in bold face resp. italics
% 3. For Figures, Tables, Lists, Verbatim-Environments (unformatted text), References/Links,
%    etc. see below.
% 4. Look at CuttingSurface.tex , ReadSTAR.tex, or Domainsurface.tex as good examples.  
% 5. A Latex book (Latex Einf√ºhrung Band 1) is available for further questions
%    (usually on Peter's desk)

%
% short description what the module does
%
\textbf{LineReduce} replaces a straight line built up of several
segments by one line segment and thus reduces the amount of data. Two
neighboring line-segments are recognized as parallel if their mutual
angle (modulo 
\latexonly 
$\pi$ 
\endlatexonly 
\begin{htmlonly} 
pi 
\end{htmlonly}) is smaller than a given limit.

% #1  path for eps
% #2  picture name
% #3  scale factor

%-------------------------------------------------------------
% You can use this type of environment for all figures w/o caption
%-------------------------------------------------------------

%
% short information about versions 
%
LineReduce is available in COVISE version 4.5 and
higher. The module is tested on SGI and Linux systems.

% Notes for using the 3 environments for tables below:
%-------------------------------------------------------------
% 1. In some cases it may be necessary to increase the size of a column, 
%    e.g. change the value of p for the type of input or output ports from 3.5cm to 4cm
% 2. If you have more than one entry in a cell but you don't want to place 
%    them in the one row, use "\newline", not "\\". For the first column you have
%    to specify explicitly the size of the coloumn ("p{xxcm}", not "l" as in a previous
%    version of this template).
% 3. Please check that the first line (heading line) of your longtables is ended
%    by "\endhead" instead of "\\". This forces replication of the header in case
%    the table crosses page boudary.
