We look at the example map {\tt covise/net/examples/ReadTascflowTDI.net} 
concerning the ReadTascflowTDI module. The object in this example consists of one 
channel and one pipe. The channel has an embedded grid just for computational reasons. 
Therefore we don`t want to see the surface of the embedded grid. 
In this example EliminatePolygons gets those polygons from the module ReadTascflowTDI 
who belong to this added grid. The fist figure shows you the surface before 
elimination. The pipe is closed. This does not make sense. The second figure  
shows you the real conditions.
