We consider a typical example of using AssembleUsg. Our aim is to create particle 
traces. The Reader output are blocks of structured grids. 
We  convert the structured grid into an unstructured one. This task is done by 
the module StoU. Then we use AssembleUsg to assemble all block of 
grids to one grid. This example is without timesteps so we really have only one 
grid. You should use FixUsg to delete unnecessary nodes before you start Tracer. 
Finally the module Sphere makes spheres out of your particles. The following image 
shows you particles at the end of the pipe.
