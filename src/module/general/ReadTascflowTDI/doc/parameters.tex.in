\hline\hline
	steprsopath & Browser & The first timestep results (RSO) file location. 
	This parameter is optional and it should contain at least one digit. 
	The following timesteps results files will be detected and read automatically 
	during the execution and the number of them should be set in 'timesteps' 
	parameter.   \\
\hline
	gridpath & Browser & The basic grid (GRD) file location. 
	Immediately after the grid file was selected, {\bf ReadTascflowTDI} 
	starts reading the 'database' to gain information. 
	This might take some time for large data sets. 
	The parameters region\_names, vector\_data, scalar\_data are updated 
	and you can select the data you want to have at the corresponding output 
	ports after the 'database' is completely indicated (you have introduced 
	all desired input files: GRD,RSO,BCF).  \\						
\hline
	rsopath & Browser & The results (RSO) file location. This parameter is optional.
	 Immediately after the results file was selected, {\bf ReadTascflowTDI} 
	 starts reading the 'database' to gain information. This might take some 
	 time for large data sets. The parameters region\_names, vector\_data, 
	 scalar\_data are updated and you can select the data you want to have 
	 at the corresponding output ports after the 'database' is 
	 completely indicated (you have introduced all desired input 
	 files: GRD,RSO,BCF).  \\
\hline
	bcfpath & Browser & The block-off and boundary condition (BCF) file location.
	This parameter is optional. Immediately after the BCF file was selected, 
	{\bf ReadTascflowTDI} starts reading the 'database' to gain information. 
	This might take some time for large data sets. The parameters region\_names, 
	vector\_data, scalar\_data are updated and you can select the data 
	you want to have at the corresponding output ports afterthe 'database' 
	is completely indicated (you have introduced all desired input 
	files: GRD,RSO,BCF).  \\		
\hline
	timesteps & Scalar & The desired number of timesteps. 
	This parameter is optional, but when it is used, you should indicate also 
	the first timesteps results file in 'steprsopath' parameter. \\
\hline
	skipped\_files & Scalar & The desired number of skipped timesteps files. 
	This parameter is optional and it's useful when you have a big number 
	of timesteps files and you want to skip some of them. \\ 
\hline
	region\_names & Choice & The name of the region to be highlighted.\\
\hline
 	show\_region & Choice & The color to be used to highlight the region.\\
\hline
 	vector\_data\_1 & Choice & The first vector data for the corresponding 
	output port.\\
\hline
 	vector\_data\_1 & Choice & The second vector data for the corresponding 
	output port. \\
\hline
 	scalar\_data\_1 & Choice & The first scalar data for the corresponding 
	output port. \\
\hline
 	scalar\_data\_2 & Choice & The second scalar data for the 
	corresponding output port.\\ 
\hline
 	scalar\_data\_3 & Choice & The third scalar data for the corresponding 
	output port. \\
