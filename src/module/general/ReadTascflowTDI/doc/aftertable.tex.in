% examples for using this module

\begin{covimg}	
{}{ReadTascflowMap}{covise/net/examples/ReadTascflowTDI.net}{0.7}\end{covimg}

{\bf ReadTascflowTDI} reads a dataset from 3 files /covise/data/examples/general/tascflow/grd for the grid, 
/covise/data/examples/general/Tascflow/rso for the results file and /covise/data/ examples/general/Tascflow/bcf 
for block-off and boundary condition. With the choise parameter vector\_data\_1 we have selected \_UVW\_ (velocity) 
for the output port vector1 and P (pressure) for output port scalar1. {\bf DomainSurfaceStr} is connected to the output port grid  and computes the outer surface of the set of structered grids. The {\bf EliminatePolygons} module 
is connected with the bcf\_polygons of the {\bf ReadTascflowTDI} module and surface output port of the {\bf DomainSurfaceStr} module and eliminates the walls between the surfaces of the grid. 

If you want to eliminate the block off regions, the second output port (block) should be connected to {\bf StoU} module which will do the conversion from structured to unstructured objects. This objects will be connected to {\bf SelectUsg} module and its parameter Selection will be set to 0. 

The module {\bf Color} maps the selected data to colors and through the {\bf Collect} module 
which is connected to the {\bf Renderer}, the colored surface is displayed in the Renderer. 
For visualizing the selected vector data we use the {\bf TracerStr} module which computes particle 
traces as lines. The particle traces starts on a line defined with startpoint\_1 and startpoint\_2.
(Hint: To see these particle traces, cut off part of the geometry by using the Renderer
option Viewing 
\begin{htmlonly}>>\end{htmlonly} \latexonly $>>$ \endlatexonly clipping plane with Point
(0.000,0.1500,0.000) and Normal (0.000,1.000,0.000))

For highlighting the regions, you should connect the third port (region) directly to the {\bf Renderer} 
after selecting the desired region in region\_names parameter (for example PIP\_S). 
You can select also the color in region\_color parameter.
(Hint: To see this highlighted region as shown in the second renderer image, cut off part of the geometry by Viewing 
\begin{htmlonly}>>\end{htmlonly} \latexonly $>>$ \endlatexonly clipping plane with Point
(0.000,0.0500,0.000) and Normal (0.000,1.000,0.000) and select color=white)

If the data set contains timesteps files and you want to use them, then select the first 
file of timesteps in steprsopath and write the desired number of steps in timesteps parameter. 
If you would like to skip some files, indicate the desired number of skipped files for
each step in skipped\_files 
parameter (if you write 1, for example, then every second file will be read).

The resulting grid and data can be observed in the next pictures of the Renderer. The second picture 
shows an interface between grids and a highlighted region.
    

\begin{covimg2}	{}{ReadTascflowTDIRenderer1}{0.7}\end{covimg2}

\begin{covimg2}	{}{ReadTascflowTDIRenderer2}{0.7}\end{covimg2}


If there are some memory allocation problems which can occur in the TDI routines 
because of some large data sets, you could increase the value of RWK, IWK and CWK 
in the section ReadTascflowTDI of covise.config file.
