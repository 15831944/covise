%=============================================================
%

For examples you may take a look at both examples
of
\covlink{ReadPAM}{ReadPAM}{../../IO/ReadPAM/ReadPAM.html}.
But lest you do not have a license for the DSY library, without which
you will not be able to run these examples, we have used
\covlink{RWCovise}{RWCovise}{../../IO/RWCovise/RWCovise.html}
in order to create six files for six scalar quantities used
in the second of those examples. The first of this quantities
is the real time for the time steps of a simulation, 
and the other five stand for the temperature in five chambers
of an airbag. With these files we may create the map shown below
using six 
\covlink{RWCovise}{RWCovise}{../../IO/RWCovise/RWCovise.html}
modules in the functionality of readers.

\begin{covimg}{}
                {MakePlots_map}{covise/net/examples/MakePlots.net}{0.7}\end{covimg} 

\begin{covimg}{}
                {MakePlots_Airbag}{Temperature in five airbag chambers}{0.45}\end{covimg}
