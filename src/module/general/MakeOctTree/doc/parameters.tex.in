\hline\hline
	normal\_size & scalar & The bounding box of the
        geometric domain is uniformly divided into several
        octrees (subdomains). 
        The number of octrees is influenced by this parameter.
        Its meaning is as follows: if the grid were uniform,
        then the number of cells in each subdomain would be
        with good approximation the value of this parameter,
        as long as the total number of cells is of course high enough.   \\
\hline
	max\_no\_levels & scalar & The maximum number of levels
        in an octree. \\
\hline
        min\_small\_enough & scalar & When an octree leaf contains
        less than some number of elements, leaf division is interrupted.
        This number is in general greater than the value of this parameter,
        but you may influence it through this parameter.\\
\hline
        crit\_level & scalar & From this level leaf division
        is interrupted if a would-be son-cell contains as many
        cells as the parent.\\
\hline
        limit\_fX & scalar & This parameter influences how the
        bounding box of the geometric object is subdivided
        into a number of subdomains for as many octrees. In particular
        this parameter limits the number of division in the X-dimension.\\
\hline
        limit\_fY & scalar & See comment for limit\_fX.
        This parameter limits the number of division in the Y-dimension.\\
\hline
        limit\_fZ & scalar & See comment for limit\_fX.
        This parameter limits the number of division in the Z-dimension.\\
