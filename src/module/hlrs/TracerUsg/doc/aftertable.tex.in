In this example we integrate the velocity field in a domain for 6
different initial conditions. This domain is defined by a set with two
structured grids. A StoU module is used to get a set of unstructured grids.
One might use in this case %TracerStr without any need for StoU,
\covlink{TracerStr}{TracerStr}{../TracerStr/TracerStr.html}
without any need for StoU,
but we use this procedure for the sake of illustrating TracerUsg.
Observe in the renderer images below that in the domain there
are some regions, which coincide with blades in a rotor, with null velocity.
This regions are shown in blue.
The colours on the line map the magnitude
of the velocity. 

The output is produced below for two cases. With the
default value for wall detection (parameter Speed\_thres), the trajectories
stop when they arrive at the border between the grids, because a
severe discontinuity of the velocity field is detected. The output (Speed\_thres=0) may be
seen in the first image. The second image (Speed\_thres=-1) shows what happens if
we deactivate this feature by introducing a negative value
for parameter Speed\_thres. A similar effect could be achieved by introducing
a big enough positive number. The deactivation of this feature may be useful if we know that
the discontinuity appears because the velocity in both domains
is measured in different reference systems. The trajectories are then continued
in the second grid.
