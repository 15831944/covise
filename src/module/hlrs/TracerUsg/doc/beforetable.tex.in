% short description what the module does
%



TracerUsg performs computation of particle tracks inside 
unstructured grids or blocks of unstructured grids. It
uses a Runge--Kutta 2nd- or 4th-order numerical integration method. It may 
handle also time steps.
In this latter case the output may not be the physical 
trace of particles in the fluid, 
but it may be helpful for the sake visulisation.

{\bf Note:}

Module obsolete - kept for compatibility with 5.1 only, but support 
discontinued - use {\bf Tracer} (new with 5.2) instead!


%Some precomputation {\it (see Examples)} is required in order to be capable of handling
%larger datasets near real-time.
