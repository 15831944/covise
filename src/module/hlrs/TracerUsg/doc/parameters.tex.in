\begin{longtable}{|p{2.5cm}|p{4cm}|p{7cm}|}
\hline
   \bf{Name} & \bf{Type} & \bf{Description} \endhead
\hline\hline
	no\_startp & Slider & number of particles to trace.  \\
\hline
	startpoint1 & Vector & Start point of a line, if startStyle is line,
         or a corner point of a rectangle of stating points, if startStyle is plane. \\
\hline
        startpoint2 & Vector & End point of a line, if startStyle is line,
         or the opposite corner point of a rectangle of stating points, if startStyle is plane.  \\
\hline
        direction & Vector & Vector describing the direction of one side of the rectangle of initial points
                             (only relevant if startStyle is plane). \\
\hline
        amesh\_path & Browser & File containing a two-column ASCII list of
        block number pairs, which indicate the neighbourhood of the grid blocks.
        The functionality associated to this parameter is still in construction, so
        you need not worry about it.  \\
\hline
        option & Choice & Order of the Runge--Kutta integrator. \\
\hline
        stp\_control & Choice & Step control method:
 
        ``position'' computes the time step using the velocity and the cell size at
        the current position, \latexonly 5$<$angle$<$12 or 2$<$angle$<$6
	\endlatexonly \begin{htmlonly} 5 < angle < 12 or 2 < angle < 6 \end{htmlonly} compute the step width using
        the angle between two velocity vectors, in a way that the time step is increased
        or decreased in order to try to remain in the pertinent interval. The first
        choice is by far safer than the other two options. \\ 
\hline
        tdirection & Choice & You may choose among:

\begin{itemize}
\item forward
\item backward
\item both
\end{itemize} \\
\hline
        reduce & Choice & Reduction of the number of points in the streamline. ``Off''
        disables reduction, ``3deg'' and ``5deg'' use the angle between the velocity        vectors for reducing the number of points. Reduction of points also includes reduction
        of corresponding data values. ``3deg'' and ``5deg'' therefore don't display
        data on the streamlines as accurately as in the ``Off'' case, especially
        where the reduction may be very strong, that is to say, where the lines are almost straight. \\
\hline 
        whatout & Choice & Select what data will be available at the second output
        port. You have the choice between the velocity magnitude (``mag''), the x, y, or
        z component (``v\_x'' ``v\_y'' ``v\_z''), or the module may assign a fixed number to
        a line (``number''). When mapping the data on the line to colours and you have
        choosen ``number'' each line has a different color.  \\
\hline  
        trace\_eps & Scalar & Relative tolerance for deciding if a point is in a cell.  \\
\hline
        trace\_len & Scalar & The integration for a line is interrupted when it attains this length.  \\
\hline
	startStyle & Choice & how should the particles 
          starting positions be arranged:
            %(only the two first options
            %are supported at the moment): 
	 \begin{itemize}
         \item line: connecting line between startpoint1 and startpoint2
         \item plane: a quad defined by its diagonal (startpoint1/2) and a side (direction),
%	 \item sphere: sphere through startpoint1/2, whose center is in the middle
%	 between the two startpoints
%         \item box: defining a cuboid by its room-diagonal (startpoint1/2), normal and
%	 direction
	 \end{itemize}  \\
\hline
         MaxPoints & Scalar & It limits the maximum number of points in the
	 output lines.\newline
	 Note: If velocity goes to 0, it makes no sense to increase "MaxPoints"
	 - ignore the corresponding message! \\
\hline
         MaxSearchFactor & Scalar & It sets a limit to the maximum size of a box
              about a possible starting point, in which the starting cell is looked for.
              For grids in which the element sizes do not vary very wildly, the
              default value will usually be big enough; but it may eventually
              happen that you have to increase this number for this module
             to be able the find the cell containing some point. 
             The greater the value of this parameter is set, the slower
             this module will be. In this sense, the default value
             is rather conservative.
             But if the integration has been interrupted by the module and
             this was not correct, this
             may be a sign that a greater value of this parameter is
             required. On other occasions this may be an indication
             that a wall has been incorrectly detected (this is only relevant
             for grid sets), then you have
             to modify parameter {\sl Speed\_thres}. \\
\hline
         Speed\_thres & Scalar & It sets a threshold for wall detection.
         When the trajectory crosses the border between two blocks 
         (two grids that are elements in a set), the module
         works out the velocity on both sides and their difference. If the
         length of the difference is less than this parameter multiplied
         by the maximum of the magnitudes of both velocities, then the module
         assumes that this interface is not a wall. Otherwise it interpretes 
         that a wall has been found and the integration is interrupted. If you
         want to deactivate this feature, then introduce a negative number.
         This has in general the same effect as if a huge positive number
         were introduced. \\
%	 NOTE: only line and plane supported at the moment \\
%\hline
%        loppDelta & Scalar & Parameter for loop detection. \\
\hline
        Connectivity & Boolean & If TRUE the reader assumes
        that the grid connectivity is correct in the sense that
        it may be used in order to determine the neighbour cells
        of a given cell. TRUE is the default value because then
        the performance is better. Nevertheless, it may happen
        that in your grid the connectivity may not be relied upon
        for this purpose, for instance if some parts of the
        grid have been refined in a such a way that some nodes
        are lying between two elements but they only belong to the element
        of the refined region. Then you have to set this parameter
        to FALSE, otherwise the trace integration is interrupted
        when this unconnected interface is reached. \\
