% short description what the module does
%

TetraTrace performs computation of particle tracks inside {\bf tetrahedra-only} grids. It
therefore uses a runge-kutta 4th-order numerical integration method with adaptive
stepsize.

{\bf Note:}

Module obsolete - kept for compatibility with 5.1 only, but support 
discontinued - use {\bf Tracer} (new with 5.2) instead!

Some precomputation {\it (see Examples)} is required in order to be capable of handling
larger datasets near real-time.

{\it Notes:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item You can convert unstructured-mixed-celltype-grids into tetrahedra-grids with Tetrahedronize.
\item If you use block-structured grids the particle trace could stop at computational borders of these grids. To solve this problem 
please use AssembleUsg and FixUsg behind the module Tetrahedronize in the pipeline, and set the parameter searchMode to {\tt Save} if necessary.
\end{enumerate}
