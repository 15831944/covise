You have to use this pipeline in order to use TetraTrace with a mixed-celltype
unstructured grid. Note that you should save the results from Tetrahedronize, TetraVolume
and TetraNeighbor so you don't have to recompute them. TetraNeighbor will go
multi-processing (10 nodes) to speed up the process. Still TetraNeighbor is the slowest
step in this pipeline.

Because no suitable (fast enough) algorithm for determining time-neighborship has yet
been found those will be computed by TetraTrace {\it (for the passed cells only)} in
real-time.

{\bf Tetrahedronize requires the grid on the first port and the per-vertex velocity-data
on the second.} You should not change Tetrahedronize's parameter because that feature has
not been heavily tested and might result in non-sense output.
