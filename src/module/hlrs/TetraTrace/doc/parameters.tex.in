\begin{longtable}{|p{2.5cm}|p{4cm}|p{7cm}|}
\hline
   \bf{Name} & \bf{Type} & \bf{Description} \endhead
\hline\hline
	startpoint1 & Vector & Start point of a line or of a quads diagonal \\
\hline
        startpoint2 & Vector & End point of a line or of a quads diagonal  \\
\hline
        normal & Vector & normal of the quad  \\
\hline
        direction & Vector & vector describing the direction of one edge of the quad (see
	figure) \\
\hline
	numStart & Scalar & number of particles to trace  \\
\hline
	startStep & Scalar & if transient grid/Data: in which step should the traces
	start  \\
\hline
	whatOut & Choice & select which data to output: number, velocity, magnitude;
	currently only velocity and magnitude are supported  \\														
\hline
	startStyle & Choice & how should the particles start positions be arranged: 
	 \begin{itemize}
         \item line: connecting line between startpoint1 and startpoint2
         \item plane: in fact it is a quad defined by its diagonal (startpoint1/2),
	 normal and direction
	 \item sphere: sphere through startpoint1/2, where the center is in the middle
	 between the two startpoints
         \item box: defining a cuboid by its room-diagonal (startpoint1/2), normal and
	 direction
	 \end{itemize} 
	 NOTE: only line and plane supported at the moment \\
\hline
	traceStyle & Choice & How should the particle traces be represented:
	currently only points is implemented and any other selection will also result in
	points  \\
\hline
	numSteps & Scalar & Number of steps to compute. If tracing on transient grid/data
	this number representsd the number of complete cycles traced. So if you have a
	non-cyclic data-set you should set this to 1 \\
\hline
	stepDuration & Scalar & stationary: how long should a particle be traced in each
	step
	
	                        transient: what time does one timestep represent \\
\hline
	numNodes & Scalar & number of nodes/processors to be used for multiprocessing  \\
\hline
	multiProcMode & Choice & Select your machines multiprocessing-mode: currently
	only SGI-MP is supported, selecting Workstation results in single-processing
	(default)  \\
\hline
	searchMode & Choice & quick is really quick while save is pretty slow but will
	not run into problems if using grids with holes. Unless you are using pretty
	weired grids you shouldn't use/need the save-mode.  \\
