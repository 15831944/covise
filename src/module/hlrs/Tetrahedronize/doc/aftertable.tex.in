{TetraTraceMap}{covise/net/tutorial/tutorial\_vel\_2.net (obsolete)}{0.6}\end{covimg}

You have to use this pipeline in order to use TetraTrace with a mixed-celltype
unstructured grid. Note that you should save the results from Tetrahedronize, TetraVolume
and TetraNeighbor so you don't have to recompute them. 

Tetrahedronize requires the grid on the first port and the per-vertex velocity-data
on the second. You should not change Tetrahedronize's parameter because that feature is
not yet implemented.
