% short information about versions 
%

The COVISE renderer is based on the OpenInventor high level object oriented 
graphics toolkit developed by Silicon Graphics. OpenInventor itself uses 
OpenGL, the 3D graphics standard as its rendering interface.

SGI Systems ship with OpenInventor 2.1 and OpenGL 1.2, there are no
additional requirements.

The Rendering speed can vary significantly, depending on the graphics
adaptor and the quality of the OpenGL implementation. Currently we support SGI, HP and Linux platforms.
Spacemouse/Spaceball as input device is currently only supported in the SGI
version.


Another thing regarding OpenInventor has to be mentioned: On SGI we currently
support three different Inventor releases: 1.1, 2.0 and 2.1.2. Depending on
the eoe subsystem installed on your machine there should exist a link from
one of these renderers (Renderer11,Renderer20,Renderer21) to a module called renderer.
