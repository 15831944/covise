Troubleshooting

If you installed the vrml exporter without Administrator privileges,
the installation of the VisualStudio runtime environment probably failed.
During 3ds Max startup, you will get an error message indicating thet vrmlexp.dle could not be loaded.
If this is the case, then please install the VisualStudio runtime manually. You can find the installer in:
...Program Files\VrmlExp\vcredist_x86.exe

have fun!
