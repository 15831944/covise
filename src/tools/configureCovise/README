The approach for the config tool is the following
the parser reads the values of the config file and translates it into tcl code
which is used by the GUI ( which has to be written), so that the gui shows the current values.

How to change the syntax?
For this purpose the file coviseconfig.grammar has to be changed.
If new new tokens are introduced , these have to be added to token/section or token/item or token/specifier.
Since the syntax of covise.configis so uniform you normally can use one of the macro ONEENUM, THREEFLOAT and so on.
If your rule does not fit into this scheme you have to add a new macro to coviseconfig.yacchead.
