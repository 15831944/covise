How to reduce read in vrml models.

1) edit OpenSceneGraph/src/osgPlugins/Inventor/ReaderWriterIV.cpp
2) add:

 // if a state exists attach it
    if((ReaderWriterIV::quality >= 0) && (ReaderWriterIV::quality <= 1))
    {
        SoComplexity* complexity = new SoComplexity;
        complexity->value = ReaderWriterIV::quality;
        rootIVNode->addChild(complexity);
        printf("Complexity set %f\n", ReaderWriterIV::quality);
    }

	Note: SoComplexity node needs to be before the read in node
	also attach it to SoSeperator node... (need to deal with how to
	set the complexity value

Rendering issue involves the number of nodes in the scenegraph!! :/
