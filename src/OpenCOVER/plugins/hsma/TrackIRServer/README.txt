 - This program extracts data of a tracked object from a connected TrackIR or Optitrack camera and sends the information to "TrackIRPlugin".

 - Adjust the ip-address and ports at both sides, default value is localhost:7050. Firewall adjustments may be necessary.

 - Tested with a TrackIR5 camera setup, TrackIR4 and OptiTrack V100 should also work as well.

 - Currently, there are no TrackIR/OptiTrack drivers available for Linux.

 - This plugin has to be started before Cover.
