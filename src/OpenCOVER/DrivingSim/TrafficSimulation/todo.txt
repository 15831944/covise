TODO List for Traffic Simulation:

- include pointer to junction in road transition list, adapt road transition
list applications
- remove code in fiddleyard being introduced for workaround of junction
  recognition in one single example: motorway.xodr
- try more efficient virtual acceleration computation by computing all
  driven lane scenarios at once
- reworking overtake behaviour, for example no overtakes before junctions
- better velocity limiting to curvature, more foresight
- no lane changeat near zero velocity, if there's no space between
  neighbouring cars anyway
