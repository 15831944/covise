Covise Image Lib
================


The Covise Image lib contains of the following classes:


coImage
=======

End-User access class of the Library. Supplies the functions for 
accessing the Image's data and description (size, # of bitplanes,
#of frames).

coImage contains a pointer to the Format-dependent class, which
implements reading the file into a buffer. This class must be a 
sub-class of coImageImpl.

coImage holds a table mapping suffixes to virtual c'tors of the 
implementation classes. The Ctor of coImage checks the file for
its suffix and then calls the virtual c'tor to create the internal
format-dependent class object.

Format-dependent classes register themselves at coImage by calling
the static function registerImageTyp(). The function returns a bool,
which should initialize a static global variable.

coImageImpl
===========

Base class for all format-dependent implementation classes. It supplies
common variables for all sub-classes:

      int width_;             
      int height_;            
      int numChannels_;        
      int numFrames_;

which can either be set by its cTor or by the implementing class.

It also supplies the error-handler, currently a function 

      setError(const char *)

which sets the state to "bad" and and error string is set, which can
be requested by the user of the coImage class

coImageTEMPL.cpp / coImageTEMPL.h
=================================

Template for implementing format classes

coBinImage
==========

Derived from coImageImpl, it implements an image in memory without a
file behind it, e.g. created by a scaling operation

coBadImage
==========

Derived from coImageImpl, it implements a dummy looking like an image
but just transporting an error message.
