Please note:
------------

- Every test project needs at least one presentation step (with viewpoint).
- The first presentation step has to be the active one when saving the project.

- If a specific config file is required, add it in ../config/ using the same name as the coprj.
- Otherwise, ../config/default.xml will be used.
